			<h2>Enterprise Software</h2>
			<p>
				The <abbr data-title="Automated Test Equipment">ATE</abbr> systems of the past have always been "islands of
				automation". They are great at carrying out complex functions and collecting data, but not as great when it comes to
				connecting with existing test and data systems. The complexity of setup configurations, backups, and file repositories
				can slow down the development process. Guru, Roos Instruments' file repository system, was designed to simplify the
				process of storing data and sharing it throughout multiple test and data systems.
			</p>

			<h5>What is Guru?</h5>
			<p>
				If Cassini is a collection of parts that function as a single unit, Guru is the nervous system that connects it all
				together. The application works in concert with the Cassini's software and runs quietly in the background.
				Guru gives the user three powerful tools in one:
				<ul>
					<li>An easy-to-use interface for managing software updates.</li>
					<li>A tool for organizing test configurations, resources, and data for easy retrieval.</li>
					<li>An automated repository to simplify design iteration and setup recovery.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h5>Communication Hub</h5>
			<p>
				These functions are further enhanced by guru's integrated networking capabilities. Built-in data flow and permission
				controls can be accessed through the Guru Agent Interface. The application makes it easy to share networked data,
				allowing the user to manage large amounts of data with confidence. Distributing test settings or data between multiple
				Cassini's across the world is now as easy as sharing data between testers in the same room.
			</p>

			<h5>Network to Other Gurus</h5>
			<p>
				Guru creates a hierarchy with other Gurus, which helps control the flow of data from one tester to another. If a request
				cannot find a file on a local hard drive, Guru automatically requests it from its parent Guru. Test code,
				configurations, and data can be shared between Gurus for quick distribution and validation. The flexible setup allows
				the user to expand upon any network scheme to suit their specific needs for the test system.
			 </p>

			<h5>Automated Backups</h5>
			<p>
				Each Cassini system has a local Guru that backs up every configuration, resource, and test result to a "backup" Guru
				server automatically. This process prevents data loss from a computer failure, which is one of the most costly and
				disruptive failures that can be encountered on a test floor. Cassini is designed to get back up and running as quickly
				as possible in the event of a controller failure. Installing a replacement controller is as easy as inserting the Guru
				key and plugging in the network cable. As soon as the user powers up the Cassini once again, the controller will request
				backup files from Guru automatically. The restore process takes seconds as the Guru recovers files from the local
				repository and makes the new controller a duplicate of the previous configuration. The entire process is quick and easy,
				and the user does not need to worry about data loss or a lengthy reprogramming of the new controller.
			</p>

			<h5>Test Distribution</h5>
			<p>
				A tester fulfills two distinct roles in its life on the production floor: test development and production testing.
				During the development phase, the tester is used to explore different configurations with the aim of creating the most
				efficient test cycle for the production floor. In the production phase, configuration is locked, and the fastest, most
				reliable test is run the same way repeatedly for a high test volume. Guru provides a great degree of control during both
				phases for simplicity and reliability throughout the entire process.
				Development:Experiment with new software
				enhancements without disrupting production. Log incremental changes in tester configuration. Simulate and validate test
				plans before release.
				Production: Lock test plans and configurations. Restrict permissions to key files and
				configurations. Simplify user interface to display only the controls essential to test execution.
			</p>

			<h5>Managing Information</h5>
			<p>
				Cassini draws upon a variety of resources to execute a test: handle configurations, test patterns, calibration data,
				fixture definitions, etc. Guru acts as organizational tool to keep these resources linked to their respective test
				plans. As files are created and modified, they appear chronologically in a revision history that mirrors the test
				iteration process. Guru also allows the user to tag each file with metadata for easy grouping and retrieval. For
				example, a test pattern can be assigned tags to designate "in development" from "released for production". This allows
				the user to locate the files and load them as a set and control which sets should be accessible to operators on the
				production floor.
			</p>

			<hr>

			<h5>Guru is like a file system</h5>
			<p>
				It is used to store files such as Test Plans and Test Executives, data files,
				calibration information, and even system software and updates. Files in Guru are like those in a database which can be
				accessed by file name, like a typical file system, but they can also be found using "metadata", or keys and values
				assigned to the file. For example, a test executive has key values such as "in development" and "released to production"
				to easily find the execs which should or should not be seen by operators on the production line.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru is networked to other Gurus</h5>
			<p>
				Unlike a normal filesystem, Guru is a specialized database networked in a hierarchical
				way. If a file is requested from a Guru and it does not have a match, the Guru requests the file from another Guru which
				acts as a server. In this way, Test Plans can easily be shared among testers simply by placing the Test Plan on the
				shared Guru server. Each tester connected to it will find the Test Plan when it is needed by the operator. The
				networking of Guru requires a TCP port, typically port 50000, for communications with other Gurus. The connection is
				firewall-safe since the client or "cache" Guru always initiates the communications with the "server" Guru. There is
				never a need for the server to contact the client directly, so communication is permitted simply by opening a port for
				outgoing communications.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru is script capable </h5>
			<p>
				Guru is able to start programs on timed events, such as
				when Guru is itself started or every hour while Guru is running. A Guru Agent script is available that copies files from
				the Guru to another file system -- either a disk drive or a FTP server. Files can be selected using the Guru keys and
				values, for example, to send any new data logs to a special FTP account for processing by your own database.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru is secure</h5>
			<p>
				Every file is digitally signed by the Guru which created the original file. The signatures
				are checked by any Guru which receives the object and if the signer is unknown to the receiver, the document is not
				trusted. Files may also be encrypted by Guru so that only a Guru with the matching key can decrypt and use the file. The
				encryption and decryption is done automatically so the end user is not burdened with the process.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru is safe</h5>
			<p>
				Each RI <abbr data-title="Automated Test Equipment">ATE</abbr> System local Guru is backed up automatically to a "backup" Guru server. Every
				document that is saved locally is also sent to the backup Guru. If the controller which operates the tester fails,
				getting back up is as simple as rolling out a new controller with the operating system loaded and connecting it to the
				network. As soon as the tester is started, the new empty Guru will start requesting files from its backup Guru
				automatically. The "restore" process is completely transparent to the user. It may take a few milliseconds longer to
				retrieve the file from the backup Guru, but the file is saved again locally making the new Guru a duplicate of the
				failed computer. This reduces downtime for a computer failure, one of the most disruptive failures that can occur on a
				test floor.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru keeps revision histories</h5>
			<p>
				Each time a file is revised and stored in Guru, the previous edition is saved
				in the file's "history". If the previous version is ever needed, it can easily be retrieved and made current. This
				automatic revision history occurs for all files stored in Guru, including Test Plans, Test Executives, test data,
				calibration data, etc. When the disk gets too full, the oldest revisions are discarded according to an expiration
				policy.
			</p>

			<h5>Guru helps us support the tester</h5>
			<p>
				We maintain a Guru server at Roos Instruments which distributes software
				updates to our customers. It also gives customers a way of sending back data such as "service request" information that
				helps us diagnose and fix software issues which may occur in the field.
