        At RI, we know there is more to a successful ATE system than testing parts. The RI system is designed to be a total solution. Our customer support strategy combines large company quality and commitment with small company speed and flexibility. Extensive
        experience enables RI to assist with customer specific issues such as handlers, probers, fixturing, correlation and custom data requirements. On-site training and installation ensure a smooth integration onto your factory floor. The sum of these
        parts equals the total solution offered by RI.
      </p>

      <h6>Bench vs ATE Measurements</h6> Speed and repeatability.
      <h5>Planning, Installation, Training and Support</h5>
      <p>
        Ensure your success with RI support and consulting. Your Roos Instruments system planning begins even before your purchase decision. RI engineers analyze your testing requirements and test system configuration, then recommend the package of source, test
        head and fixture modules which will meet your complete RFIC/MMIC testing requirements. Installation planning continues through production and delivery. After delivery, RI engineers and technicians are onsite providing technical assistance and
        consulting through the complete acceptance test process. Your test engineers and operators are thoroughly trained in all aspects of test plan design and system operation, RI system support includes one year of telephone and BBS technical support,
        software updates, onsite preventive maintenance, on site calibration and module exchange to fine-tune your testing configuration. This support network makes it possible for RI to respond to customers in a quick and efficient manner. The RI menu
        for after-sale support services is unmatched, as is the availability of these benefits.

      <h6>Calibration</h6>
      <h6>Test Development</h6>
      <h6>Yield Management</h6>
      <h6>Architectural Advantages</h6>
      <p>
        There is a major architectural difference in how Cassini testplans are defined and executed. Most ATE software is written in a high level language as a set of procedures which is then compiled and executed in order by the PC using the tester hardware.
        Cassini testplans involve defining the state of the ATE and the device, taking some data and then performing math operations. The Cassini compiler then computes the fastest means to collect the data. By removing duplicate state changes and ordering
        the sequence to minimize the use of expensive state changes, we have seen 30% reductions in test times. The execution is also different in that the compiler generates a stream of hardware changes which are executed by a FPGA based state machine
        and not the PC. This removes quite a bit of PC related delays during test execution and frees the PC to perform other tasks.
      </p>
      <h6>Datalogging Advantages</h6>
      <p>
        Datalogging is also handled differently. In most ATE the user adds log requests throughout the testplan causing the execution to pause at each request and write to a file. In Cassini the logging is handled by the math subsystem and is held until the testing
        is complete. While the part is being binned the log is generated. By doing a single write at a time when testing is not being impacted can have a big impact on test time.
      </p>
      <h6>DUT Programming Advantages</h6>
      <p>
        RI's ATE have always used a protocol aware approach to handling device serial programming. Because of this, the pattern generators are optimized for short patterns which can be changed based on test results. It appears that this is a big help for parts
        which are controlled and not just scanned.
      </p>
      <h6>DC &amp; Digital Advantages</h6>
      <p>
        Cassini's DC instruments are not really power supplies but are power audio amplifiers. With smooth, symmetric responses, low noise and wide bandwidth, they require less bypass capacitance on the load boards and therefore have faster settling times.
      </p>
      <h6>RF Advantages</h6>
      <p>
        And finally, our RF measurement approach uses a direct to baseband IQ conversion instead of DSP at an IF. What this means is that we get RF measurement data with no DSP reducing the amount of data collected, transferred and processed. The data we get
        with a single sample may require 2000 samples and the associated processing in traditional mixed signal ATE. When we do need DSP on the capture we have implemented the DSP in the FPGA attached to the converter thus doing it in real time as part
        of the capture.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In summary, there is no rocket science here. Decisions we made twenty years ago on architecture have worked out well and still seem to give the best performance for complex RF devices.
