      <p>
        The privacy and protection of your personal and financial information is very important to us. This privacy statement fully describes our information gathering and dissemination practices. <strong>We will never sell
		any information gathered about you.</strong> Roos Instruments uses your personal information for building your Roos Instruments account, and facilitating the request for quote (RFQ) and RI Kit ordering process using the catalog.
      </p>
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Roos Instruments only uses cookies while you are authenticated (signed on) for security and authentication.
      </p>
      <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        When you register with our site, we ask for your name, company name, phone number(s), e-mail address. Your initial password is sent to your email address, confirming your identity. We will use email or phone information to contact you when necessary.
        If you purchase a product or service from Roos Instruments, the information you give (such as your credit card number, purchase information, billing and shipping adddress information) is provided to the banking merchant. Details regarding the
        purchase are supplied to the international distributor or vendor partner when applicable. This is necessary to complete the transaction. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties, except to the extent necessary to provide
        you with a requested service, under circumstances required by law, or, in rare cases, to our business partners as outlined in this policy. We will never use your information for direct marketing purposes. You will not be contacted directly by
        any third party as a result of your relationship with Roos Instruments. Any business partners with whom we share your information will be subject to confidentiality restrictions preventing them from sharing your personal information with others.
      </p>
      <h2>User Account Application</h2>
      <p>
        If your company has assigned a Company Account Administrator, when registering as a Full User, the Company Account Administrator for your company will receive a notice of your pending authorization that will include your name, email address and phone
        number. This is so the Company Account Administrator can contact you to inquire about your request.
      </p>

      <h2>Security Precautions</h2>
      <p>
        Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We use the industry standard SSL/TLS (secure socket layer) encryption and actively monitor and update systems used by the
        website.
        <!--When you transmit credit
				card information to complete a purchase or verify data, we always transmit that
				credit card number in an encrypted format.  Your credit card information is discarded
				after the transaction has been completed.<br>-->
        In addition to our encryption standards, your Roos Instruments account information is password-protected so that only you have access to this personal information. Please do not disclose your password to anyone. Always remember to close your browser window
        when your transactions are complete. This helps keep your account safe. While we strive to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, Roos Instruments cannot ensure or warrant
        the security of any information during transmission to or from our site, and you submit information to us at your own risk. However, we do our best to ensure the highest level of security on our systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2> (Full disclaimer is in the <a href="legal.html">Legal Notice</a>)
      <p>
        Ultimately, you are held responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Always be careful and responsible whenever you are online.
